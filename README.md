   .- CodeBook.md : a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
   
   .- run_analysis.R : performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
           
        1.- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

   .- FinalData.txt : is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
